# 🗿🤙
- 👋 Hi, I’m Iker Nieto
- 👀 I’m interested in sports (especially football (the real one, not eggball) and calisthenics), videogames and programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning system administration, and programming in my spare time
- 🌍 I know English and Spanish, so feel free to talk to me in any of those
- 💞️ I’m looking to make my own projects so I can improve at programming. I'm specially interested in server-side and low level programming (though I have to learn them in a more deep way)
- 📫 My discord is kinire08#6499, feel free of talking to me here
